# Speechalizer

This application was built during a competition at the Technical University of Munich.

It **counts the number of occurrences** of a given phrase in **Xi's speeches from 2013–2023**, using reliable and standard Python 3 libraries and functionalities.  
Additionally, it **returns the context** for the chosen phrase within a specified range, and provides a **link to the full speech**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Although the UI is currently very basic, the application is fully functional and returns reliable, correct results.
